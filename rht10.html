            <h1>10.Anees Ibrahim</h1><br><br>
            <p>Anees Ibrahim is the son of a former Criminal Investigation Department's havaldar, Ibrahim Kaskar. <br><br> He is the brother of Dawood Ibrahim.<br><br> The same family also has another wanted felon on its roster. <br><br> Anees Ibrahim is Dawood Ibrahim's younger brother. <br><br> Involved, charged, and named as a co-defendant in every crime Dawood Ibrahim is accused of committing is a need. <br><br> He is in charge of planning activities including phoney currency, extortion, and drug dealing.
        <br><br>Anees Ibrahim is a Mumbai based wanted Indian terrorist, criminal mobster and the brother of Dawood Ibrahim, who heads the organized crime syndicate, D-company. <br><br>

    <p>He is said to be the brains behind the day-to-day operations of the gang and plays a role in the decision-making process of the criminal syndicate, since the D-company and its proxies continue to dominate organized criminal activities in India and also spread across continents today. <br><br>
        
        D-Company reportedly commands over 5,000 cadres, involved in smuggling, global hawala operations, counterfeit currency, extortion, contract killings, illegal betting and, allegedly, major financial scams. <br><br>
        
        The D-company enterprise is challenged both from outside and from within, with Dawood Ibrahim’s unconfirmed split with his long-time aide, Chota Shakeel, due to the fact that Anees and him reportedly have had a falling out due to Anees’s influence in the D-Company that led to Shakeel parting ways with his long-time boss. <br><br>
        
        This is a major reason as to why Dawood Ibrahim still remains in key control of crime-terror empire, intimidation, since capacities for punitive enforcement and personal loyalty are integral to its continuity. <br><br>
        
        Succession in such formations always results in fragmentation. His neutralisation by any means- including a natural death- would bring Ibrahim’s networks under great stress and build major vulnerabilities. <br><br> 
        Anees is known to be involved in narcotics trafficking, extortion, contract killings, and money laundering on behalf of D-Company, which is an organized criminal syndicate founded and controlled by his brother, Dawood Ibrahim, operating transnationally across India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. <br><br>
        He is also accused of involvement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts. He and other leaders of D-Company are the subjects of Interpol Red Notices for their suspected involvement in the 1993 terrorist bombings in Mumbai in which 257 people were killed. <br><br>
        Currently among the world’s most wanted fugitives along with the D-company. The United States Department of Treasury named both Ibrahim and D-Company as Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act. <br><br>
