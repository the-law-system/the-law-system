    <p>Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (born 5 June 1950) is a Pakistani Islamist who co-founded Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based Islamist militant organization that is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council,India, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union,[15] Australia, and Russia.
        
        He is listed on India's NIA Most Wanted. <br><br> In April 2012, the United States placed a bounty of US$10 million on Saeed for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 civilians. <br> <br> While India officially supported the American move, there were protests against it in Pakistan. <br><br>

        After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, he was designated by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council. <br><br> He is also listed on the United States Department of the Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. <br><br>
        
        India has demanded that Saeed be handed over into Indian custody by Pakistan; however, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries. <br><br> Saeed has denied ever being a leader of LeT and has said all allegations that he planned attacks in India are baseless. <br><br>
        
        In July 2019, three months before the scheduled reviewal of Pakistan's action plan by the Financial Action Task Force, Saeed was arrested by Pakistani authorities and sentenced to an 11-year prison sentence. <br><br> In early April 2022, he was sentenced an additional 31 years for terror financing.</p>
