    <p>Lakhvi was born on 30 December 1960 in the Okara district of Punjab, Pakistan. Belonging to the Lakhokay (village) caste, his mother is Maulana Moeenuddin Lakhvi πs stepsister,[11] an Ahl-e-Hadith scholar and leader who died in 2011 at the age of 93.[12]

        In 1982, he would participate in the Afghan Jihad, eventually becoming LeT's military chief. <br><br>
        
        In 1999, at a three-day annual congregation held at Muridke, he explained the reason for fidayeen suicide squad missions in the aftermath of the Kargil War: "After the Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil and the Nawaz-Clinton statement in Washington, it was important to boost the morale of the Kashmiri people. <br><br> These Fidayen missions were initiated to teach India a lesson as they were celebrating after the Kargil war. <br><br> " He said that the next target would be New Delhi. <br><br>
        
        In 2006, he asked LeT's members to begin training operatives for suicide bombings. <br><br> In the past, he told operatives to mount attacks in well-populated areas. <br><br> Indian officials claim Lakhvi also oversaw Azam Cheema, who has been accused of being a leader in the 2006 bombing of the Mumbai rail network that killed more than 200 and left 700 injured. <br><br>
        
        In May 2008, the US Treasury Department announced that it had frozen the assets of four Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders including Lakhvi.</p>
